# KarKi_GH_2023

## About KarirKita
KarirKita is a web project developed by a group of high school students. As its name suggests, Karir Kita (which translates to "Our Career" in English) aims to empower newly graduated students by providing them with invaluable assistance in preparing for job interviews. The platform achieves this by offering mockup or simulation interviews conducted through a video calling system, enabling students to gain essential experience, advice, and feedback from industry professionals in real-time.

## How we built it
For the video calling system we used WebRTC and ICE and STUN servers were used for the connections. The UI was built using CSS, HTML and JavaScript.

## Team Challenges
We ran into many challenges while working and even before the hackathon began, this being our first hackathon, we were especially nervous and unprepared. Unluckily one of our members fell ill just 2-3 days before the hackathon so he was unable to join our discussions. Even worse, on the 2nd day of the hackathon, another one of our members became sick and had to leave a bit earlier so we were left to only 3 people. 

## Technical Challenges
Since this is the first hackathon we've joined we were quite unprepared to work under time pressure, also the fact that none of us are very well versed in web development, we were met with many difficulties. Namely having smaller bugs like the redirect for the login page not working properly, UI being messy and unsatisfactory and the laptop camera's feed not being displayed properly. The connection between computers is also an issue so we have reverted to having a local connection. But thankfully, most of the smaller bugs have been fixed and we think the UI turned out quite nicely

## Accomplishments and things we learned
We got much further with this project than we had originally expected, especially since this is our first hackathon, but overall we had completed most of the things we wanted to do. Even after multiple setbacks, one person down and seemingly heaps of work ahead of us, all we did was take a break to collect our thoughts and we managed to pull together and create a decent project. Of course our project isn't perfect nor is it even very good, but we're satisfied with what we accomplished in these 36 hours and we have learned so much about ourselves and programming as a whole. We hope to improve and we look forward to Garudahacks 5.0!
